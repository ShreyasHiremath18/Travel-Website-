A public transport timetable is a document setting out information on public transport service times, to assist passengers with planning a trip.
The timetable will list the times when a service is scheduled to arrive at and depart from specified locations. It may show all movements at a particular location or all movements on a particular route or for a particular stop.
Traditionally this information was provided in printed form, It is now also often available in a variety of electronic formats.
